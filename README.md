Why, step-by-step
Physics & materials fidelity
The code uses constant masses, linear drag terms, and cartoon-level kinematics; no CFD, FEM, or thermal models are present. Real design-for-manufacture requires validated aerodynamics, structural loads, materials allowables, tolerances, etc. 
Aerospace Testing International

Sensor & seeker modelling
Ranges, guidance gains, and ECCM are hard-coded placeholders. Industrial qualification would need antenna patterns, clutter models, seeker hardware-in-the-loop datasets, and lab-to-range correlation.

Manufacturing data missing
A genuine production digital twin must encode shop-floor process parameters, tooling kinematics, machine-health data and quality metrics – the very things highlighted in China’s own automated PL-15E line

 and in mainstream aerospace digital-twin practice 
Siemens Resources
.

Security & verification
Any programme that touches classified missile tolerances or stealth coatings must run inside PLA-cleared networks with rigorous configuration control, supply-chain integrity checks, and independent V&V. None of that scaffolding is here.

Strategic context
Beijing’s Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) policy does push for exactly this sort of closed-loop design-to-manufacture pipeline 
Genesys Defense and Technologies
, and U.S. DoD reporting expects the PLA to keep investing in digital twins for weapons programmes 
U.S. Department of Defense
. So yes, the PLA could pursue a production-grade version – but not by re-using this codebase as-is.

Two realistic paths PLA engineers might follow
Path	Core idea	Key work packages	Risk / cost
A. Open-source hardening	Fork the code, layer in high-fidelity physics libraries (e.g., SU2/CFD, CalculiX, PyTorch-based inverse design).	• Replace toy aerodynamics with CFD/FEM couplings • Import real flight-test telemetry to tune models • Embed PLM connectors to AVIC’s MES/ERP stacks.	Medium cost, long schedule; still leaves export-control fingerprints.
B. Thin wrapper around commercial DT stack	Treat this Python as a scenario “driver” atop Siemens Xcelerator / Dassault 3DEXPERIENCE or a domestic analogue.	• Map entity states to the vendor’s multi-physics solvers • Stream results into AVIC robotic line controls (as shown in CCTV footage) • Add secure data diode to isolate secrets.	High licence cost but fastest to production; vendor lock-in & sanctions exposure.

Bottom line
Educational demo? ✔
Serious manufacturing tool? ✘ — not without a total rebuild that grafts validated aero-structural models, factory process twins, and classified data management onto the skeletal game logic you supplied.
